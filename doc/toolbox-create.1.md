## NAME
toolbox\-create - Create a new toolbox container

## SYNOPSIS
**toolbox create** [*--distro DISTRO* | *-d DISTRO*]
               [*--hostname HOSTNAME*]
               [*--image NAME* | *-i NAME*]
               [*--release RELEASE* | *-r RELEASE*]
               [*--volume BINDMOUNT*]...
               [*CONTAINER*]

## DESCRIPTION

Creates a new toolbox container. You can then use the `toolbox enter` command
to interact with the container at any point.

A toolbox container is an OCI container created from an OCI image. On Fedora,
the default image is known as `fedora-toolbox:N`, where N is the release of
the host. If the image is not present locally, then it is pulled from a
well-known registry like `registry.fedoraproject.org`. The container is
created with `podman create`, and its entry point is set to `toolbox
init-container`.

By default, toolbox containers are named after their corresponding images. If
the image had a tag, then the tag is included in the name of the container,
but it's separated by a hyphen, not a colon. A different name can be assigned
by using the CONTAINER argument.

### Entry Point

A key feature of toolbox containers is their entry point, the `toolbox
init-container` command.

OCI containers are inherently immutable. Configuration options passed through
`podman create` are baked into the definition of the OCI container, and can't
be changed later. This means that changes and improvements made in newer
versions of Toolbox can't be applied to pre-existing toolbox containers
created by older versions of Toolbox. This is avoided by using the entry point
to configure the container at runtime.

The entry point of a toolbox container customizes the container to fit the
current user by ensuring that it has a user that matches the one on the host.
It ensures that configuration files, such as `/etc/host.conf`, `/etc/hosts`,
`/etc/localtime`, `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/timezone`, inside the container
are kept synchronized with the host. The entry point also bind mounts various
subsets of the host's filesystem hierarchy to their corresponding locations
inside the container to provide seamless integration with the host. This
includes `/run/libvirt`, `/run/systemd/journal`, `/run/udev/data`,
`/var/lib/libvirt`, `/var/lib/systemd/coredump`, `/var/log/journal` and others.

On some host operating systems, important paths like `/home`, `/media` or
`/mnt` are symbolic links to other locations. The entry point ensures that
paths inside the container match those on the host, to avoid needless
confusion.

## OPTIONS ##

The following options are understood:

**--distro** DISTRO, **-d** DISTRO

Create a toolbox container for a different operating system DISTRO than the
host. Cannot be used with `--image`.

**--hostname** HOSTNAME

Create the toolbox container using the specified hostname (default: toolbox).

**--image** NAME, **-i** NAME

Change the NAME of the base image used to create the toolbox container. This
is useful for creating containers from custom-built base images. Cannot be used
used with `--release`.

**--release** RELEASE, **-r** RELEASE

Create a toolbox container for a different operating system RELEASE than the
host. Cannot be used with `--image`.

**--volume** BINDMOUNT

Create the toolbox container with additional bind mounts. Use the same format as
--volume of podman. Can be specified multiple times.

## EXAMPLES

### Create a toolbox container using the default image matching the host OS

```
$ toolbox create
```

### Create a toolbox container using the default image for Fedora 30

```
$ toolbox create --distro fedora --release f30
```

### Create a custom toolbox container from a custom image

```
$ toolbox create --image bar foo
```
