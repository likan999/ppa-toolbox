## NAME
toolbox - Unprivileged development environment

## SYNOPSIS
**toolbox** [*--verbose* | *-v*] *COMMAND* [*ARGS*]

## DESCRIPTION

Toolbox is a tool for Linux operating systems, which allows the use of
containerized command line environments. It is built on top of Podman and
other standard container technologies from OCI.

This is particularly useful on OSTree based operating systems like Fedora
CoreOS and Silverblue. The intention of these systems is to discourage
installation of software on the host, and instead install software as (or in)
containers â€” they mostly don't even have package managers like DNF or YUM.
This makes it difficult to set up a development environment or install tools
for debugging in the usual way.

Toolbox solves this problem by providing a fully mutable container within
which one can install their favourite development and debugging tools, editors
and SDKs. For example, it's possible to do `yum install ansible` without
affecting the base operating system.

However, this tool doesn't *require* using an OSTree based system. It works
equally well on Fedora Workstation and Server, and that's a useful way to
incrementally adopt containerization.

The toolbox environment is based on an OCI image. On Fedora this is the
`fedora-toolbox` image. This image is used to create a toolbox container that
seamlessly integrates with the rest of the operating system by providing
access to the user's home directory, the Wayland and X11 sockets, SSH agent,
etc..
